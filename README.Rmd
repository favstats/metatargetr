The goal of `metatargetr` is to parse targeting information from the [Meta Ad Targeting dataset](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/fort-ads-targeting-dataset/) as well as retrieve data from the [Audience tab](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&country=NL&view_all_page_id=175740570505&sort_data[direction]=desc&sort_data[mode]=relevancy_monthly_grouped&search_type=page&media_type=all) in the Meta Ad Library. It also includes some helper functions to work with Meta ad library data in general.

## Installation

You can install the development version of metatargetr like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("favstats/metatargetr")
```

## Load in Package


```{r example}
library(metatargetr)
```

## Get Targeting criteria (Last 30 Days)

The following code retrieves the targeting criteria used by the main page of the VVD (Dutch party) in the last 30 days. Just put in the right Page ID.

```{r}

last30 <- get_targeting("121264564551002", timeframe = "LAST_30_DAYS")

head(last30, 5)

```

## Get Targeting criteria (Last 7 Days)

The following code retrieves the targeting criteria used by the main page of the VVD (Dutch party) in the last 7 days. Just put in the right Page ID.



```{r}
last7 <- get_targeting("121264564551002", timeframe = "LAST_7_DAYS")


head(last7, 5)
```


## Get Images and Videos

The following code downloads the images and videos of a Meta ad. It also retrieves additional info not present in the Meta Ad Library API (e.g. `page_like_count` `cta_type` i.e. call to action button). Just put in the right Ad Archive ID.

It automatically handles duplicate images and videos (of which there are many) by hashing the images and videos and making sure they are not saved twice.

This piece of code was created in collaboration with [Philipp Mendoza](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/m/e/p.m.mendoza/p.m.mendoza.html).

Note: You will need the [OpenImageR](https://github.com/mlampros/OpenImageR) R package for hashing to run!


```{r}

get_ad_snapshots("561403598962843", download = T, hashing = T, mediadir = "data/media")

```
